# 2-Player-Pong
Personal take on the traditional game pong, but with two players instead of playing with an AI.

The Pygame module for Python 3 is needed to run this. WHEN RUNNING THIS GAME FROM THE TERMINAL MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING USING PYTHON VERSION 3 AND ABOVE (ex: python3 pong_2_player.py, if by default you are not running Python 3)

Coded this from scratch without referencing online examples, so perhaps this is quite a novel take on the game.

Focused more on the OOP aspects of integrating the Pygame module, where all the game entities (the board and the ball) and the 
game events, logic and display were part of some of class or class method.

Interesting features include keeping score of each player, no of current hits, and gives players the restart option.

Another version that might be interesting is a 4-Player game, which I think would be quite easily integrated into the way the 
objects (player boards) are created. Might do it in the future.

Hope you have fun!!
